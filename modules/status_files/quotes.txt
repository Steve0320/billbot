You can run, but I'll still be in your nightmares!
Old Man McGucket! Spittin' in a bucket!
FIGHT LIKE A HILLBILLY!
Why do I have a bandage on m'beard? Why didn't anyone point that out?
Follow me into this dark dangerous alley!
You're just in time for the turf war with the hillbilly that lives in m'mirror!
Stop watchin' me while I bathe!
Git in there, raccoon wife!
_Coyotes are coming for our sweetbreads_
Donkey spittle!
So there I am, fighting a raccoon for the same piece of meat, when our mouths get close and we kiss accidentally!
...and then I learned to operate a stickshift with mah beard!
Lately, I've been tickerizing with a voice alterizing tonic. On account of my HORRIFYIN' VOICE!
